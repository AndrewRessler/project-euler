# project-euler
Andrew Ressler's custom Project Euler problem solutions. The goal is to write short, clean solutions that take advantage of best Python (or whatever language) practices. To run a solution, simply execute:

```bash
python problem_001.py

As of 2/27/25, solutions go up through Problem 3.
